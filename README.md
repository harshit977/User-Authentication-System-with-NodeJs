# User Authentication System with Node-Js 
## About
This project provides Authentication services to the user by providing Signup/Register and Login/Logout APIs. It has various layers of authorization and authentication to provide maximum possible security. This complete project doesn’t use any Auth Libraries like Passport, JWT etc or any OAuth services. So, all the APIs are constructed from scratch by taking care of security at each and every level. It uses token based authentication through custom made expirable tokens( not JWT) which are encrypted & decrypted via crypto using a secret key.

#### It is developed using Node.js as Node Package Manager & ExpressJS and MongoDB as its Back End framework and database system respectively.
